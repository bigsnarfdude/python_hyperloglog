# python_hyperloglog

The code implements HyperLogLog (HLL), a probabilistic data structure for efficiently estimating cardinality (count of unique elements) in large datasets. It provides methods to process lists of integers, longs, and strings, converting them to HLL format while maintaining accuracy with minimal memory usage. This is particularly useful for large-scale data processing where exact counting would be impractical.
